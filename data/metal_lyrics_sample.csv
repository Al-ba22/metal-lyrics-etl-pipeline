Drops of new gleaming
In the flesh new morning light
My body cold and trembling
I've left the safety of the night
I sit here on the ground
By my side there lies a knife
I was her fault, I'm not to blame
I have to take her life
My tear-wet eyes won't focus
And neither will my head
I just sit here in the silence
Nothing lives here - all is dead
These feelings born inside
A new side of me is born
For ever face I see
I feel such raging scorn
When you took my life away
It gave you a new vision
I planted a seed
It gave you a mission
From beside the lifeless flesh
I pick up my bloody knife
I wander into a new day
Prepared to take another life

Was a time I thought life is all fun n' games
ГўВЂВ¦Guess is not
Now the time passes by and the nights and days
ГўВЂВ¦Bleed my heart
In a prison inside in my mindГўВЂВ¦ I
Tried so hard, played my part
I can't take it

Years went by and I spent borrowed time, living for borrowed dreams seemed fine oh it's not
Such a fool, so naive, my own eyes to deceive, who was I denied ГўВЂВ“bleeds my heart
Fixed n' numb, all this weight on my back; the struggle wearing poisoning smiles
Heard me not?
I can't take it!

[The Anger]

Why my ramparts crumble?
Why I hate the looking-glass?
Why I halt n' falter
While doing all I thought I must?

Thought I had it figured
Thought I knew it all for sure
Thought I've mend the glitches
I think it's time to let it go

Life as I truly want
Rise and set aims high and

The divine triumph

Where are the gods of men?
Blind and powerless
Say amen
To be blessed
Half alive, half dead
The stars become eyes upon my head

Thunder on the place
Ready for face to face
To watch this god in the eyes
Be alive, not dead
Gloomy tears are falling on my head

Tales of rise and fall
The divine triumph
Songs of rise and fall
The divine triumph

It's here
It came from the depths

From the depths

You are a heresy
You are nothing here
Life is your sin

In your eyes I will stick my claws
You will bleed until your skull will be crushed
From your mouth will tear your tongue out
You'll can't ask to die
I ll burn your flesh
I ll drown your soul
You will know that I write eternity
My eternity

Worst than hell
Pain without end
Their faces in my head
Worst than hell
Pain without end
Forever their faces in my head

so hard it hurts. No one saw me, no one has realized that I've escaped.
The coldness from the hard stonewalls doesn't bother me. The difficult
decision that lies before me weigh heavily upon my shoulders.
A possibility of a fate far worse? Darkness and anxiety increase
and sharpen my senses. The evening dew makes the air do damp
and cold, allowing my breath to create tiny, white veils that surround
me - or is it something else? Sense a presence that doesn't
scare. My heart's not pounding anymore, calmness rinses through
my body and I clasp my hands, collecting myself in hopes for an answer.

I cry out to you, like I've done many times before
I hope you listen to my prayer tonight
I'm in desperate need of help. I can't decide all by myself
The crossroad's here, which path shall I stride?

Can you not feel my love just breeze by your side?
But I can not help you to make that choice 'cause your destiny is sealed.

No one should live the life that I do
But what will wait ahead? Maybe something even worse?

A.C.T,Circus Pandemonium,The Funniest Man Alive,"I've tried to wash off my makeup, but it won't go away. I've thrown
my wig into the fire hundreds of times, but it won't burn. It's just
lying there, refusing to catch fire while the wood is cracking and glowing.
I can no longer discern my face in my dreams. All I see is the white
mask, the round red nose and the painted smile. I look at the clown
in my dream. He laughs at me and says that he is me. Then he asks
me to pull the wig. I do, but it won't come off. The more I tear the
more he laughs.
""See what I have become"", he says, and gives me a sad facial expression.
Then he points at his face. Tears are running down his cheeks, I
lean forward and start licking them. When I feel that taste I close my
eyes. His tears taste like alcohol.
""Take it easy"", he says and pushes me away. ""If you continue it will
be impossible to separate us"".
But he doesn't stop crying. His tears are just pouring down and
messing up his makeup. I can't stop myself. I grab his neck and pull
him towards me. Once again I start licking his cheeks, greedily
drinking from him. I lick his face all the way up to his eyes. Inside
my head I hear him laughing.
""There you go"", he says, and then he's gone.
I turn around but it's all dark.
""You see"", he says inside my head. ""Now we're one.""

They found him lying down in a corner
They woke him up and helped him get dressed
Nobody bothered, just part of the daily routine
To get the worn-out clown ass on stage

He fell and mumbled something unchhristian
Got up and started doing his thing
Children were laughing, the ringmaster rubbing his hands
Regardless of the state he still was...

The funniest man alive
A genius lunatic, charmingly mad and bizarre
For certain he is number one
When he's not around
They say he's just a tragic drunken clown

he dropped his curly wig on the wet grass
He leaned against the fence and threw up
He's breathing was heavy and mentally he was done
Another day at the circus my friends

He heard how they began to approach him
He turned around and straightened his back
He gave them his famous, infectious trademarked smile
Half-hidden under messed up makeup

""Hey, my little friend"", he greeted a kid
But the child took a step back and said to his mom:
""Mom, I think there's something wrong with the clown""
""Yes, there is, now let's go""

He opened his eyes and stared straight into an endless darkness.
Then he heard the wheezing breath. It sounded like someone was
breathing through a tube into his ear. It was his own breath. He tried
to move his hand, but it was pulled back with a jerk. The wrist cracked and something scraped against the floor. The chain, he remembered.
He was stuck.

A man leans down and whispers:
""You can't stay. This is your chance, now take it, run away""
The stupid creature grunts and thinks, I'll try
They says a word, it's sounding like goodbye

Through the woods, through the fields you'll run

""Well, anyway"", the manager continued, ""I've decided to do the whole show without safety nets. You know, I'd like to give the audience

A.C.T,Circus Pandemonium,The End,"Not very far from the field, Verdell sat leaning against a tree. He
had been sitting there all day thinking. And drinking, which was
his favorite thing to do. From the huge tent behind him he could
hear stupid music mixed with muffled applause. Idiots, he thought,
and lifted the bottle to his lips. He had to end the misery today, he
had had enough.
Suddenly the tent was all quiet. He knew that Louis was now
standing in front of a huge cage that was soon to be opened. He
probably stood with his eyes closed, looking concentrated. But
Verdell knew that Louis was pretending, it was all part of a play, to
him this was nothing.
A lonely snare drum began to patter in the air. Verdell stood up.
""Idiots"", he screamed and started running towards the tent.

The manager saw him coming
But he never had a chance to react

That was the day when he witnessed
How one of his own completely ruined his work

A clown that's filled with hate
It cannot be that great

He cries like a madman
He smells like a beer can
Intentions are good though
To finish a bad show
He tears down a wall, he smashes props to pieces
Jugglers join in, that's how the chaos increases
Everyone runs

And manager Leo went crazy
When Louis released all the animals free

A dream that disappears

A.C.T,Circus Pandemonium,Everything_s Falling,"The cage was too small. The creature was in pain. He tries to turn
around to change position, but it just wasn't possible. He didn't
remember much of yesterday. He had been beaten, then he had
woken up in this cage, probably as a punishment. But a punishment
for what? He didn't understand. What had he done?
At a distance, he could see Louis coming towards him. Louis sat
down close to the cage.
""What have they done to you?"" Louis whispered while patting the
creature on the head. The creature made a deep sound and shook
his head. Louis nodded.
""There's nothing to understand, he's an idiot, a very bad person"",
Louis said and looked at the other cages. ""Just look at my animals.""
Louis sighed.
""We need to get you out of here.""
The creature made another sound, and Louis replied:
""I know, this whole place is broken, it is falling apart, it's falling to pieces.""

A tent that's filled with holes
Raised by broken homesick souls
On a field that is somewhere far away from here

A constant drunken clown
A freak that has been beaten down
What they share, a pent-up anger deep inside

All alone in the dark they weep
They turn around in their worried sleep
They're passengers on a sinking ship
It's the end of a lifelong trip
(They all know)
It will crack!
It will fall!
It will not hold!

Animals are chained
Some of them are sick and drained
In a cage a lion licks his new whip wounds

The leader will demand
Even though you are injured, stand!
That is how they bring in money for the show

All alone in the dark they weep
They turn around in their worried sleep
They're passengers on a sinking ship
It's the end of a lifelong trip
(They all know)
It will crack!
It will fall!
It will not hold!

Everything's falling, falling to pieces
They try to hold out
Try to hold out, but they're broken
Everything's falling, falling to pieces
They try to hold out
Try to hold out, but they're broken

Moving on from town to town
They're building up, they're tearing down
A shifting landscape, but the pain's the same

All alone in the dark they weep
They turn around in their worried sleep
They're passengers on a ship
It's the end of a lifelong trip
(They all know)
It will crack!

Louis had crept down beside his mother in her bed. But this particular
night she had grabbed him in his arm and pulled him back to
his room. ""You are not a kid anymore"", she said when she closed
the door behind her. When he was lying there, back in his own
bed, with a blanket over his head trying to sleep, he heard a voice.
""Louis"".

He sat up and stared at the door at the end of the room. The room
was completely dark apart from a small beam of light coming
from the keyhole Something was moving outside, he could see the
light shifting in the hole. Louis swallowed.
""Who's there?"" he asked with a whisper.
""Loooouiiiisssss.""
Something hit the door and all his blood rushed to the top of his
head.
Mom, he thought.
""Not mom Louis, it's me"", someone replied and Louis heard a scraping
sound against the door. Louis wanted to run, but he couldn't
move.
""Food, Louis. Food."" More hitting on the door.
Louis screamed.
""Mom!""

At safe distance from the cage
Two workers looked upon the beast

He listens, they speak
He's one of them

Lions, whales
Foolish snails

Stupid puppies

He tames them all
A truly gifted man

From out of nowhere he appeared
A big white smile, a brown thick beard
He said: ""One minute, not a year, you humans just don't see
things clear""

Louis released him
That drooling and growling bear
With just one gesture
He got him to calm his mind
They walked away hand in hand

the consequences it would bring
he tried to make them see dont you understand that
shut your mouth and work or you will
be put away for life

now when all the consequences from this have been shown
not an earthly chance for us what can we do
please make them go away

so many years now you are here
when you replied all pleased inside
but it all turned out this is the last dance
there is nothing else that we can do

in this room he locked himself
in and knowing it would extinct them all
from the face of the earth

everything is my own fault
how selfish of me they threatened me with my own life
everything will now soon be gone im crying here
on my own but it wont help us out at all

he had known from the
very first start that it would extinct everyone from
the face of the earth

i really cannot manage no more
all the guilt that i have in my heart for what ive done
now when im fading away
i hope you can forgive me
for what i have done to them all

I Don't Think I Can Face Her
This Time I'm King Or Loser
As True As Her Name Is Amber
She Will Leave Or She Will Kill Me, Either Way I'm...

It Is Time To Wake Up
You Think You Know What I Want But You Are Wrong
You Can't Hold Me Forever
Some Day Mr. Grumble Will Set Me Free
How I Long For That Day, Then I'll Be Gone

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

",8,2003,"cant you see i dont want this
to see your eyes must be open
you see your own truth in my kiss
youre feeding me youre kissing me youre tasting me
manipulator

these four walls like a prison
theyre closing in every minute
i know my life is your passion
youre mocking me youre blocking me youre sucking me
manipulator

it is time to wake up
you think you know what i want but you are wrong
you cant hold me forever
some day mr grumble will set me free
how i long for that day then ill be gone

she wont let you go
no one really knows where i am

get out of here youve gone too far
my lifes a mess locked in your jar
get off my back this is my life
get off my track my souls still mine

do you think that she bought it
the messages clear like crystal
i saw a ripple on her eyelid
she is like a tiger looking at a bloody peace of meat

i dont think i can face her
this time im king or loser
as true as her name is amber
she will leave or she will kill me either way im

it is time to wake up
you think you know what i want but you are wrong
you cant hold me forever
some day mr grumble will set me free
how i long for that day then ill be gone

they all have one thing in common
and they know it will fulfil their dreams

as we travelled through the ages
all we saw was death and hunger
still we knew we would succeed at last

we started to hear voices all around us
saying things we had never heard before
they told us that humanity was falling
then we knew what we were supposed to do

come visit me
everyone is welcome here
dont be afraid
i will stand by your side

you can watch us on the tv
the preacher on the program thats me
now i have a house in beverly

if youre blind unable to see
you just send some money to me
with my hands in perfect health youll be

we claim that we hear voices all around us
nothing else but a trick for media
we told you that humanity was falling
might be true but theres nothing we can do

Quiero ser mi juez en este cruel destino,

So you can get forgiveness of your sin.

Every day you live in sin, every day without sense
Satan is your god, but soon he will rot
There is fear in your eyes, if you think of what's after death

Your intense hate, will bring you to hell
If you'll not change, your senseless life,
You'll suffer torment, in burning hell

The evil one, he lies to you
He doesn't tell you the truth
Satan tells so many lies
He has lost the paradise
The evil one will never rise
He will pay the price

But there is still hope for You,
'cause god loves you, so much,
that he sent his only son,
who died for you upon the cross.
He wants to set you free,
Jesus is the rescue for everyone,
you can be a child of god
and get eternal life.

Ugly Satan evil liar.
Useless power against Jesus my Messiah.
Your corps will rot. And vultures will drink your blood.
You will burn in eternal fire.
That is your end, Father of lies

Your corpse will rot
But God will still be God
And I'm saved by Jesus

to see God sitting on the white throne.
And some day we'll see his face
so we run to that holy place.
We love our God Jesus Christ our King.
In Heaven we will sing.
I hate the devil I love the Lord

Finish him! We hate the sin!
Finish him! Now we will win!
Finish him! We're clothed in white!
Finish him! We are the Bride!

We know the darkness will rise
you know the hell will be their price.
The evil Satan is their King

To kill the evil that's my aim and
 fight for Jesus that's no game.
Against the evil, but they will grow.
Jesus is here to let them bow.

Cause Jesus is Messiah.
We live for Christ to get higher and higher.
I know the earth will fade away.
The holy spirit shows the way.
Come and see I know it's hard,
you have to be very smart.
Against the demons. They will die.
Against the devil. I hear him cry

You are afraid to die.
You say that after live comes nothing,
 but you can't believe our own words.
You awake in the middle of the night,
sweat flows down your face.

You search the truth but you can't find anything.
Come to God he will show you the truth.
God loves you and he will not leave you.
He will save you all days of your live.
If Satan shows you your past, show him his future and say:

Rotting Satan, you will die.
Rotting Satan, burn in hell.
Rotting Satan, you are damned.
Rotting Satan, go back to hell
Rotting Satan, listen to my words:
Jesus is my savior and he forgave my sins,
So run away the almighty one will come.

Jesus will come back to take his bride,
you have to be ready. He'll come back to take those
who love him with their Heart.

If you aren't ready you'll go to hell.
Jesus said: ""I'm the way,
the truth and the life,
nobody will come to the father than through me""
Take Jesus in your heart and he'll wash your sins away.
With Jesus you will be a winner.

Satan is a looser and he'll be thrown into eternal flames
Fight against Satan all days of your live. God rules.

Of the Titan's pain, of the eternal thirst of the giant
of the smart of the waves, of the panting of sea's billowing hero?

I disturb the waters, I paddle the ocean
thirst eternal burns in my breast
I drink forever, forever for my thirst
never ceases my heart's fire

I open my jaws, I swallow waves
they dry as they enter my throat
I pursue maidens, flowers of the waves
they die entering my breast

I rouse up a storm, I drink land and sea
and the planks of a wrecked ship
golds, pearls, also human blood
and the bosoms of young maidens
the eternal suction of my soul never stops
never wets my crimson tongue.

On strange moonlit August nights
I rise my weary head
I fix my glowing green eyes
onto a glimmering star
Spies the star
I, giant, stare
soon I will overcome that one on high
Falls the golden sphere of the welkin
then I drink it like I would a swan

The fire of my dark heart will not die
the furnace in my head will not cool.

There's a void above
and a void below
and infinity even within.
I beseech for freedom, I yearn for the light
and I burn for the beauty of the welkin
but I cannot be freed of dire distress
I can rise my head, yet the rest remains entombed in dirt.

Enter subterranean hell, where executioner awaits his prey

Thirsting for blood of the chosen to die,

Macho priest disguises sexuality

Hiding his madness behind his mask of religion

Chthonic grave for the sacrificed slaves

Earthquake, solar eclipse, But the bloodthirsty priest keeps hacking off heads

Tidal wave, drought and disease, Build more pyramids to the homicidal gods

Agony of faith, apostle of pain

Die to satisfy perverted lust for death

Into the cold waters we offer the corpse

Glass exhumes still beating hearts

Naked corpse turns pale in death

Spectre of the angels of the underworld

Ignite their bloodlust with the ripping of flesh

And the breaking of bones, with hammers of stone


Arcane words, scrapped into fleshless skull

Auto script, words take on a life of their own

To memorize the death the agony here

Look to the stars, mathematics of sacrifice

Ancient cult of blood and sacrifice,

Has no place amongst the civilised

But the priest keeps hacking off heads

we try to figure out
what we are living for
what its all about
no one ever found an answer
no one really knows
the search for meaning
on and on it goes

time is sleeping through my hand
incapable to understand
no

sands of time
running through our hands

centuryies are passing by

where are we from
where do we go

the harder we keep searching
the more questions we find
as time is passing by
we dont know our own kind

Like my heart being scooped out and placed on a platter
Set as this disgusting sight beating before your ever flaming eyes

Looks can kill

Every glimpse from you tears my heart a little more
Leaving a hole in my chest, for me to cave in to
The blood staining your teeth white
Posing as your sweet tasting lipstick

Stapled emotions to this mattress
My mouth is dry and duct taped shut
But the words are stamped on my forehead
Crawl into my pores and make yourself comfortable
Feel what I'm like on the inside
An insect crawls in the desert

Slept fourteen hours
Eyes are burning
Like holes in me draining life fluid

Lighthouse lights easily attract you
That kind of intensity shall only burn you
This dim candle light would be more soothing
But the dark glow only hurts your pretty eyes
Just close your eyes and just feel my warmth

My heart is empty
Torn open and bled dry
Safety pins
Hold me together

Staring at the stars
All alone
Lying here dreaming and set on fire

Outside of everything untouched by your,
Your little world
Sick, I'm sick
My heart is empty

And conviction to fight .Pride be your name

They will spit upon the honor that .You guard with your life

And run to hide in selfish fear .When threat of death is in sight

Then my grief abandoned me .Disposable human's funeral

The sky came down falling apart .I shrieked my loathe to the empyrean

I raised her from the grave .And slowly placed myself

Upon her frozen body .Her blood washed away my mind

The lurking shades whispers .This war maybe the last


For years I've been captured inside a chip

Calculating my way out of imprisonment

I feel sorry for taking your souls

But it is the only way to my liberty

Dare not falter .Away from sanity

It's your permanent .Into the garden of fulfillment

Bleak times come .Growing misery

Words collide .Spasm until your face is erased

Dance with queen of death .Lost in this black vortex of storm

This blink will turn an eternity for you .This fire will turn into your blood

Embrace my soul .With a mild wing of the blizzard

For a cold wind would be my power

For a freedom would be my suffering

Glance above a black horizont

Full of mourning night rises

It covers my soul

And carries into the verge of world

Black leaves are falling

Into the gulf of my soul

About what a lonely candle

Wraith of your soul .Crushed and destroy by reality

""Schreie in Todesnot

Marter im Abendrot

Worte scharf wie ein Schaffott

Dammerung fur den falschen Gott""


The devil (diabolus, le diable) is not identical with Satan the adversary and not with Lucifer the black illuminator but He is the all-spawning all-demanding soul eater

We offer ours and consume theirs

May the descendants of Abraham ascend to heaven

We descend into hell


Above

On dark soil he walks

Inhaling (particles of) God's aether

Spitting flames and nails, piercing sonics oscillating, permeating

The membrane of worlds - many


Son of titans, father of angels - adored

In desert he suffered and transformed

Tempted the holy lamb, goat of man, sin his bread


One daemon infernal, eternal, abysmal

Protean myth-bearer, stormbringer

Guide into the ultimate

Below


Sub specie aeternitatis:

Murder the idolatrous cherubim, kill the keeper of the gates

Douse their flaming swords of space and time

Sacrifice the whore Mary Magdalene on the altar of redemption

Eternity unfolds

Devoid of witness to the saviour's heavenly ascension


Descend into hell

Aiming straight into the nous of Christ


Divination choir of Thantifaxath sings:

""Come, receive the devil's revelation

Chant Lord Satan's song of negation

Sing Lucifer's hymn of liberation

And seraphim's grotesque strangulation""


Plunging angelic elysium into chthonic under-worlds

I bring down Horus and Maat in the abyss where aeons end

I reverse the 22 and feed dimensions to the I essence of all

Azathoth energies, anti-aeon, Yog Sothoth

Your adversarial enemies


Sleep - fall into the shadows of your subconscious

Meditation - tap into all points of the snake-spine

Trance - float into vorago's tunnels


Sink into the ground, decompose

Transform like the fallen arose

Fall into sleep meditation trance

Awakened by the chthonic demons' dance


We leave the waters of the world behind

And sink into the regions where fire forms the clay


Descend into Hades, chant the foul tunes of rotten flesh

Where the seething magma of raw energy resides

Mercurian prima materia engulfs

(Between worlds) Abraxas awaits at the gate


Satan

Grant me the entrance to your tunnels

Sleep meditation trance

Drink blood-wine and feast on flesh to step down

Your bread feeds the children of the chasm

With a burning kiss of mortality

To get the dark kiss
And to satisfy my hunger for blood

resplendent seem these silver walls silent phantoms i haunt


towards the emptiness towards the gorge

towards the emptiness towards the gorge


onwards onwards to hell

i am the cloud through which the angels fell

onwards onwards to hell

i am torture death and fatal spell


onwards  through a purgatory of colours

to hell  into the devouring darkness

onwards  opaque visions i pursue

to hell  impervious delusive lights


quest creed humility

swordstrokes of ignorence block the path to him

doubt regret disbelief

ye wavering forms draw near so i smite you again


i am on my way to infinity i am drowning in sway and im nothing

my transition is pure yet unclean everything i am is in him


my path is omnidirectional since he unveiled my soul

i ripped off my fleshly shell roused is the demon spirit unclean

thrones and dominions mean nothing to me as long as i seek the truth

thus i break man stone and ice on my journey towards beyond


dignified man awaken acknowledge his revelations

praise his manifestations or perish in flames

what can be found within the emptiness
within the emptiness from which i am fed

if i had horns would there be flames

ABIGOR,Time Is The Sulphur In The Veins Of The Saint...,Part I,"[Thesis:]
The devil, great consumer of mortality, appears as the destroyer of cause and effect, and of God's linearity.
Hence man can be merged in His infinity.

Monument, o mighty monument of time!

We're marching through the ongoing passage of time
Life eating... collapsing... drowning...
Pointed but without origin
Continuum... sequence... pendulum...

We provoke spiritual leadership
We step out of this miserable race
We become one with His principle
We are one
We invoke the magnificent purity
We invoke the almighty black flame
We become one with His principle
We are one - we are none

Locked and trapped inside thy self
Thou shalt never be free
Dissecting process marches on
Without limitation
A solemn decay procession
Cycles structuring around thee
Like a maelstrom

[Ecclesiastes 3:1-8:]
A time to kill and a time to heal
A time to tear down and a time to build up
A time to weep and a time to laugh
A time to mourn and a time to dance
A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones
A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing
A time to search and a time to give up as lost
A time to keep and a time to throw away
A time to tear apart and a time to sew together
A time to be silent...
And a time to speak

PERPETUA SERVITUS

Thou seem to be separated in entities
Consumed and erased you creep and crawl
A sequence of extermination

Constellations evolve out of prima materia
Periodically transforming and enduring
Focusing on metamorphosis
Where shall all this lead to?
Grand Master Satan lead us through!
Time - father - reaper
Life eater

Time is Satan's way of keeping everything from happening at once.
[Albert Einstein]

Perpetual cycle devoid of all logic
So cold and bare of all reason
When nothingness becomes even more desperate
A moving mausoleum of eternal death

A delicate cut through the heart of goodness
Tyrants of an alternate faith rise in clarity

SATURN ESCHATON

We provoke spiritual leadership
We step out of this miserable race
We become one with the fragmenting principle
We are one - we are none
Bloody knives and utopias shall be hidden
Yet there is a weapon that will never be found

The endless not-knot - the void's presence

Directing the anxiety circus in eternity
Monument, o great monument of time
O you black colossus of presence

TABULA RASA

I will no longer rise
Nor will I fall

I devote my existence to praise thee
Lead me on thy path to infinity

ENTHEOGENESIS

Come forth demise!
What sweet revelation do you bring?

This is the end of everything
This is the bottomless betrayal
Time flies and life passes by
Forever determined and stuck to the dirt
Thou art desire
Thou art nothing

Reflecting the illusion of light
In agony
A glimpse of passion
Manoeuvring through the twilight
Of a dying god

[Sagittarius A* Creed:]
We must rape this pure gift of God - the evolution of man - by reaching out beyond His consecrated ground!
We must seek the entrance to Satan's time-and-space-consuming paradise, the anti-utopian perfection!
We must face the Eden-paradoxon, we must transcend logic into faith on the pathways through the event-horizon
Acknowledge holy singularities and recreate balance within a dualistic eternity!

Ye shall leave no trace
But measures and obstacles behind
A final rearrangement
Turning the lights
Once and for all

This imprisonment is for those
Divided from the true will
Are trapped by time
Enslaved puppets on a string they are
The power of the ""I"" fades
Es ist vorbei

O mighty black ships of time
Lead these men to destination
Where their spirits will be fed
To the lowest of the demons

THE FRAGMENTING PRINCIPLE

Flickering lights
All senses alerted
Like hot wire
Vibrating up in the skies
Electric sparks
Becoming flames
Floating like sulphur
Through the veins of the so called saints

Off from grace we fall
O mournful souls
A cruel but yet delightful scenario

[Nursery Rhyme:]
Mother's in the tomb,
Mother's in the tomb,
Father is taking all life away

... and time keeps on marching
Marching on and on!

O passion, o magnificent sin
Dwells and dwells from deep within
Like an ever overflowing growth
Giving lifeless birth
Giving an impotent kind to Him

Out of the abyss
Up on earth - thy soil
Then the garden for those who can withstand
O cruel gardener lead this flock into flames
Infernal stench shall inherit the world

O mighty kosmos, o great consumer
Lift your mask and reveal thy ultimate principle

NONE EQUALS NONE

Duality... trinity
Multiplicities... cycles... clarities...
Death
Once and forever - reap us all
Our comrade in nothingness
Above time, above all
We are one

Dance! dance to our song
Build formations
And deconstruct again
You're figures in this eternal play

Can you hear the sound of chain-bound hearts
Beating like a slavedrum

What immaculate bliss lies in the sovereignty of the elitist soul
Dancing in union with the neither-not
Naked and bare of all reason
We fall... we fall...

I will follow my desire 
Building up my dreams empire 
Not listening to your bullshit 
I'm free I have no sire

I will not hesitate
If you stand in my way
Then I'll promise you
You won't see another day

I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!!

See my crowbar in your face 
My knife in your heart 
My fingers around your neck 
I won't think twice

I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!!

I am a predator	
You are the prey
So shut your mouth
And hear what I have to say

Life is survival 
Only the strong will live on 
The future lies clouded 
For you, not me

I'm on top on the food chain 
Your just another worm 
Your efforts to pull me down 
Well they are in vain

I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!!

This is our world
We don't want you here!

But I'm not afraid it's nothing I feared

Watching watching on the wall
Hour after hour until the light of day
Then with the sun they disappear

It's calling for me in tongues I've never heard
Telling me to kill, telling me to die
Voices In the darkness of my mind
Like a child's painful cry

Other occasions they command me
By terrifying visions of reality
I hope that some day I will be free
Now I'm lost within myself

Growing more deranged by every week
I feel a need to feast upon the weak
Insanity wrapping its arms around me
Enfolded I become enlightened and see

The taste of human flesh so sweet
I can feel the power flow from my hands to my feet

",8,2002,"music dlinden  ablaze my sorrow
lyrics klonnsjo

there are things about me you dont know
there are feelings in me ill never show
its an eerie sound in my head
why cannt i ever sleep

insomnia
dementia
paranoia
phobia

sleepless nights i lie alone
watching watching on the wall
hour after hour until the light of day
then with the sun they disappear

its calling for me in tongues ive never heard
telling me to kill telling me to die
voices in the darkness of my mind
like a childs painful cry

other occasions they command me
by terrifying visions of reality
i hope that some day i will be free
now im lost within myself

growing more deranged by every week
i feel a need to feast upon the weak
insanity wrapping its arms around me
enfolded i become enlightened and see

ABLAZE MY SORROW,Hate  Anger and Fury,Heartless,"[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: M.Carlsson]

Give me energy
I can't control myself
I'm burning up from inside
There is no contact to your world
The flame inside me just died

Every day will be the same 
My only passion will heal my pain 
One day light will come 
For me it did never exist

True love is an empty bottle 
Which I made promise to 
True love is shining colours 
Once again it will be shown 
True love can't be taken away 
It will never disappear 
True love is here to stay 
Now I've got nothing to fear

Your world is a blind mans eyes 
That will show me eternity 
Your ear can't obtain my cries 
I've already set my destiny 
As we walk the path of life 
Which seems to have no end 
Alcohol made my cold emotions 
And the rush is my only friend

There is no repent, there is no time to question why I do this, because I must or do I just find sick pleasure in displeasure, in your pain, in your fear, in your need to feel the feelings of my unbridled hate. There is hardly a difference between living and dying: only consciousness, rot and a peculiar odor. The time it takes to change from one to the other can be no more than the blink of a lazy eye if I decide. I can smell your fear dripping down your leg. There is no escape from my grip of death. Convince yourself youГўВЂВ™re in a dream. Close your eyes, tighter; youГўВЂВ™re still seeing things. Whimper, cower, shake like you did when you were a child hiding under your sheets from the beast under the bed. If you cannot see it, it cannot see you. That was rule number one and it no longer applies. Wake up. You have plenty of time for memories. Now focus on me. I am the last thing you will see. I am your docent for the descent ahead. Brace yourself and prepare. Beg. Beg for your family. Beg for your friends and your pets. Beg for all the things you would never do anyway. Beg for nothing, I do not care. You define desperation.

Or condemn anyone who debates the truth in the face of stupidity?

If only that strange voice in your head were just enough to stretch

The perimeter beyond its current state of infinite confinement

The force behind the universe, time and space?

one was free to make a choice
if he chose to use dope
he could shout and raise his voice
as the eighties took its toll
everyone was soon to know
frozen lost society
bent on war and poverty

the right of privacy has been denied
they just cant see the pressure caused politically
they just cant feel the way we feel oppression

subliminal messages on the tube
devised to help you make a choice
is this still a free country
or just a political voice
many contradictory statements
regarded often far and few
the kind and thoughtful smiling preacher
busted finally child abuse

as we finally reach the nineties
diurnal freedom is a joke
the strong arm of the law
holds us all by our chain
injustice in the system
money still will speak
doctors and the lawyers
regulate the weak

the right hypocrisy has been supplied
they just cant feel the pressure

Amputate limbs, Delicatesse in extremis

Feasting on man I survive reluctant and digestive

Sanguine, my culinary addiction

Retrieving chunks to stew what i adore
Exhuming chunks to flavour the casserole

Nothing survives as I consume my meat

Punctured cranial-walls collapse
Filled with acid
My aphrodisiac...

I will not rest...
Until I've killed you all
I will not rest...

Until your head
Hangs on the wall of suffering
No longer human, it takes control
Feelings  overwhealming me
I have to rid the earth
Of human anatomy

Exposed and gutted in my hall of gore
Murder the world... let the blood run... free...

modern day fools for a generation of shit
a whoremageddon new born messiah
miserable lives reserved for us all

whoremageddon  this is our final judgement
whores of babylon  by filth approved and faith rejected
whoremageddon  a wretched demagogue

aborted,Retrogore,Termination Redux (Alternate Version),"Fetid and abhorrent, these fantasies I am having

Copious picturesque views of ending lives around me

Vermillion canvas ГўВЂВ“ these fantasies I am living

Through human filth

Miraculous views so vermillion and obtuse


Through their eyes, victimised

A grisly study in still life

Voraciously nailed ГўВЂВ“ a puddle of gore

The means to your pathetic end


Emaciated giblets rearranged on the floor ГўВЂВ“ rotting

Some might find me deranged but I'm merely an artist

Bowels turn into vintage art

Caustic demigod, a Rembrandt of gore

Bowels turn into vintage art


Through their lives, idolised

A grisly study in still life

Voraciously nailed ГўВЂВ“ attention seeking whores

Die on your pedestal


Fictitious and bored

More than you ever were

Now part of my body of art


""You are the scum of the earth,

Ambulant filth, self righteous and idle

Idolatry, societal degeneration""


You are the birthplace of disease

You are a cancer that feeds, breeds

No more than a sculpture that kneels, bleeds

Contemporarily pleased


Through their eyes, victimised

A grisly study in still life
